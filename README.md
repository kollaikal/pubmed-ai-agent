##  Overview

**PubMed Summarization AI Agent** is a fully containerized, offline-friendly pipeline that fetches the latest research articles from PubMed and generates concise summaries using a local transformer model (e.g. `t5-base`). Everything is orchestrated using [Dagger](https://dagger.io/) for reproducible, zero-hassle automation.

>  No external API calls at runtime ‚Äî everything runs locally, inside your container.

---

##  Features

-  **Automated PubMed Search**: Pass a query and receive titles, abstracts, links, and AI-generated summaries.
-  **Abstractive Summarization**: Uses HuggingFace‚Äôs `t5-base` model for high-quality summarization.
-  **Fully Containerized**: Works the same across any environment via Docker + Dagger.
-  **Secure & Offline-Ready**: Data never leaves your system after the initial model pull.
-  **Easy to Extend**: Swap out models, add a FastAPI or Streamlit UI, or batch process queries.

##  Setup

### 1. **Clone the Repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/pubmed-ai-agent.git
cd pubmed-ai-agent
```

### 2. Install Dagger & Docker
Install Docker

Install Dagger CLI

### 3. Update your Hugging Face token
For public models like t5-base, no token is required.

For private models or more reliability, add your Hugging Face access token to main.py as an environment variable.

### Usage
Run this command from the repo folder:

```
dagger call run-pubmed-agent --query "AI in cardiovascular imaging"
```
The agent will print titles, abstracts, AI-generated summaries, and direct PubMed links for the top articles.

### Extending This Project
Change models: Use t5-base, distilbart-cnn-12-6, or your favorite local transformer/LLMs.

Add output formats: Save results as CSV, HTML, or PDF.

Integrate UI: Plug into Streamlit or FastAPI for interactive clinical search.

Scale up: Batch queries, add error handling, or implement semantic search.
