## üöÄ Overview

**PubMed Summarization AI Agent** is a fully containerized pipeline that automatically fetches the latest articles from PubMed, extracts titles and abstracts, and generates concise, human-readable summaries using a local transformer model ‚Äî all orchestrated by [Dagger](https://dagger.io/) for reproducible, zero-hassle runs.

> **No external API required at runtime.** All summarization happens locally inside your container!

---

## Features

- **Automated PubMed Search:** Just pass a query, get relevant articles (titles, abstracts, links).
- **State-of-the-art Summarization:** Uses HuggingFace‚Äôs `t5-base` model for abstractive summarization.
- **Runs Anywhere:** Fully containerized with Dagger and Docker, works the same on any machine.
- **Secure & Offline-Friendly:** No data leaves your system after the first model download.
- **Easy to Extend:** Swap models, output formats, or add a Streamlit/FastAPI UI with minimal code.

##  Setup

### 1. **Clone the Repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/pubmed-ai-agent.git
cd pubmed-ai-agent
```

### 2. Install Dagger & Docker
Install Docker

Install Dagger CLI

### 3. Update your Hugging Face token
For public models like t5-base, no token is required.

For private models or more reliability, add your Hugging Face access token to main.py as an environment variable.

### Usage
Run this command from the repo folder:

```
dagger call run-pubmed-agent --query "AI in cardiovascular imaging"
```
The agent will print titles, abstracts, AI-generated summaries, and direct PubMed links for the top articles.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Extending This Project
Change models: Use t5-base, distilbart-cnn-12-6, or your favorite local transformer/LLMs.

Add output formats: Save results as CSV, HTML, or PDF.

Integrate UI: Plug into Streamlit or FastAPI for interactive clinical search.

Scale up: Batch queries, add error handling, or implement semantic search.
